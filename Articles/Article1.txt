The job is done, the dream fulfilled – a podium finish at the Olympics finally for the diminutive Saikhom Mirabai Chanu. She was lost for words post her silver medal win in 49kg weightlifting. But the happiness was apparent as she sat down to talk to an eager Indian media back home courtesy an interaction organised by Sports Authority of India. The silver medal hanging around her neck, it was past 9.00pm in Tokyo.

The 26-year-old from Manipur created history by becoming the first Indian weightlifter to win a silver medal at the Olympic Games. India’s last medal in the sport came 21 years ago when Karnam Malleswari won the bronze in Sydney.

It was also India’s first medal at the Tokyo Olympics. "Everyone is happy, the dream got fulfilled," she said during the interaction.
